In this article, we will explore the legality of Quotex in India and
provide you with all the information you need to know about this trading
platform.

## Is Quotex Legal in India?

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not authorized Quotex to operate in
India. This means that Quotex is not a regulated trading platform in
India.

However, it is important to note that the RBI\'s ban on Quotex does not
make it illegal to trade on the platform. Indian traders can still
access Quotex and trade on the platform, but they do so at their own
risk.

If you are considering trading on Quotex, it is important to be aware of
the risks involved. You should only trade with money that you can afford
to lose, and you should always do your own research before making any
trades.
